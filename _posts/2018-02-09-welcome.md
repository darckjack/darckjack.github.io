Hi everybody! *read it with Dr. Nick voice*

My name is Juan GÃ³mez and I'm a web developer. There is not much else to say, I started since 2012, but professionally
since 2014. I code in c#, ruby, php, javascript and kotlin on a regular basis, but I like to solve problems in
diferent forms and I love to develop multiplatform solutions.

Without anything else to say, wellcome to this mess of mind, I hope you learn something!
