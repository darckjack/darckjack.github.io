I used to hate Java, and I mean it, __HATE__ java.

I just hate all the boilerplate, the difficult dependencies, the slow ecosystem and all that.

When I started learning android development immediately I was seaking for alternatives, 
ionic, xamarin, nativescript, all that, sadly the performance and the usage was difficult,
especially when accesing the camera and gps. When kotlin started to gain track, it was 
like a godsend for me.

But then we got a problem, we had a client tha was looking for a rapid prototype for his 
idea (a simple inventory web system) and we had to come up with the prototype in just two
weeks, neither I or one of my coworkers have many experience with rapid prototyping so we
had to search for a solution.

First we think of Rails, we had experience with it and a great workflow, but in the 
requirements was our weakness, role based authorization with complex rules, while it
wasn't a problem with other alternatives such as laravel, we don't have a very rapid
workflow with it, so we didn't have a solution.

Then I was checking twitter and I see it, [Jhipster](http://www.jhipster.tech/), 
it was Java yes, but it was looking interesting. The team had experience with java 
and spring, I had experience with angular and the documentation was so good and it 
was easy to get on.

And just like that, in four days we got the prototype and it was so easy that we started
learning it, in the end we did the whole project with the jhipster stack and it went like
a breeze.

And that was how I fall in love with java again, I should have looked more in the stack
of Java and tools like spring and jhipster itself, what makes a great developer is to
know when to use and when to not use the tools you know.
